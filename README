Zombie PHP is a PHP framework.
It is a AJAX/jQuery/multi-user/multi-group environment out of the box,
provides and MVC architecture and security features built-in.

It is still in the early stages of development. We could use
some contributors. Can't code? We still need documentation
and testers. All help is appreciated.

Peace,
Adam
