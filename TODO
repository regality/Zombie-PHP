==     TODO FILE      ==
========================
Use this file to keep track of tasks
that need to be done in the future.
Keep them in bullet form and in the
correct section.

ZOMBIE PHP
==========

 - Make sure session times out properly
   - it doesn't, fix it (db session)

 - Add new apps
   - facebook/oauth/openid login app
   - register/signup app
   - captcha, add as option under frontend template

 - make salt gen in user model os independent (linux/unix only right now)

 - install.php
   - create database?
   - only allows mysql right now

 - update PgsqlDatabase

 - SessionModel only allows for mysql, see clear_old()

 - session id is not cyrpto-strong
   - fix it
   - piggyback off php session?

 - session cookie only works for config domain
   - fix it or leave it?
      - is it more secure?

 - CSS compiler needs to check for includes within includes

 - compile code looks like death
   - compile output is just as ugly

 - NEEDS unit tests for EVERYTHING

UNDEAD JS
=========

 - deal with latency (loading screen)

 - improve performance (everything is too slow in IE)
   - May M$ burn in hell for their atrocities!

 - put get params in hash

 - abstract out alert,logged in,etc, for ajax requests and make extensible

 - add refresh attribute to app launchers

 - NEEDS unit tests for EVERYTHING

FRONTEND
========

 - beautify mobile version
   - buttons break with larger content
   - wrong scale in mobile firefox
   - needs testing in iphone, windows ce, etc

 - welcome page should be quick-start instructions

TEMPLATING SYSTEM
=================

 - allow for overwriteing app/model (include auto backup?)

 - needs additional error checking

 - add more templates
   - search engine template
   - add postgres support

 - Check mysql_frontend_form for bugs
   - it was copied from mysql_crud and modified

 - abstract out database
   - use template=crud instead of template=mysql_crud and check config

DATABASE
========

 - Create more DB classes
   - Oracle would be nice
   - Maybe some nosql: couch, mongo, hadoop?

 - Update sql install files

 - Add functions to encrypt/decrypt data for storage

GENERAL
=======

 - Somebody please make a new logo

 - organize everything to upgradable and not upgradable

 - move config to top level for easier novice access?

FUTURE FEATURES
===============

 - Testing platform

 - Include ORM? I don't like them, but some people do.
   - DooPHP has a really cool ORM, use or do something like that?
   - Doctrine or propel?
      - propel looks more cooler

 - automagic upgrade zombie

 - put a stack within a stack (undead)

 - db migration

 - add a before_filter like rails?
