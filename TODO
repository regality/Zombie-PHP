   - register/signup app
   - captcha, add as option under frontend template

 - update PgsqlQuery class

 - session cookie only works for config domain
   - fix it or leave it?
      - is it more secure?

 - compile code looks like death
   - compile output is just as ugly

 - Clone zombie-php to zombie-php-psql

 - failed migration should catch exceptions and freak out

 - compile should check for unchanged modules (faster compile time)

 - option to compile images and scripts seperately (different version number)

 - NEEDS unit tests for EVERYTHING

UNDEAD JS
=========

 - deal with latency (loading screen)

 - improve performance (everything is too slow in IE)
   - May M$ burn in hell for their atrocities!
